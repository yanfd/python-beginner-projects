This code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer (X) always either wins or forces a tie using a Minimax algorithm. The algorithm works by recursively exploring all possible moves for both the computer and the human player (O) until the end of the game. It assigns scores to each possible game state: +1 if the computer wins, -1 if the human wins, and 0 for a tie. The computer then selects the move that maximizes its score (for X) or minimizes the score (for O), ensuring it always makes the optimal move. This strategy guarantees that the computer either wins or ties but never allows the human player to win.
