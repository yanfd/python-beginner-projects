# Chat Application

Chat Application is a simple Python-based chat system that demonstrates basic communication between a server and clients using sockets. This example provides a basic console-based chat system and serves as a starting point for more complex chat applications.

## Usage

1. **Server (chat_server.py)**:

   - Run the `chat_server.py` script to start the server. It will listen for incoming client connections on the specified IP address and port (e.g., `127.0.0.1:12345`).

   - The server forwards messages from one client to all other connected clients.

2. **Client (chat_client.py)**:

   - Run the `chat_client.py` script on multiple machines to create client instances.

   - Clients connect to the server and can communicate with each other.

   - Messages sent by one client are broadcast to all connected clients.

3. **Customization**:

   - You can modify the server IP address and port in the scripts for your specific network configuration.

   - Extend the application to include features like user authentication, private messages, and a graphical user interface (GUI).

4. **Requirements**:

   - Python 3.x

## Example

Imagine you want to create a basic chat system to allow users on different machines to communicate with each other. You can run the server on one machine and connect clients from multiple other machines to start a simple chat session.
