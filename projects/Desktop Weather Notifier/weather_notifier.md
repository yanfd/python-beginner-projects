<h1 align = "center"> ğŸŒ¤ Weather Notifier ğŸŒ§ </h1>

This program was an attempt to learn about generating Desktop Notifications and using API's, using them for useful tasks.

## Working
The program mainly makes use of the `plyer` module to generate hourly dekstop notifications, and `requests` module to fetch data from the API key.

### Using the Program
To make use of the program, you would first have to get an API key for yourself.

1. Go to [`https://www.weatherapi.com/`](https://www.weatherapi.com)
2. Login with your account / Sign Up if you're new.
3. You'll receive an API key on your account page, copy it and paste it in line 33 of the program.
```py
API_KEY     = "" # your API key from weatherapi.com
```

Run the program and you shall be getting hourly weather desktop notifications :)
