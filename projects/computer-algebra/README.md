# Newton CAS Python Wrapper and GUI

This project aims to provide a Python wrapper and GUI for the Newton API, a Computer Algebra
System (CAS) that allows users to perform various mathematical computations. The GUI is built using
[DearPyGui](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) and
[Newton API](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api).

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the Newton API
  effortlessly.
- **Multiple Mathematical Operations:** Users can perform a variety of mathematical operations such as simplification,
  factoring, differentiation, integration, finding zeroes, and more.
- **Real-Time Evaluation:** Expressions are evaluated in real-time, providing instant feedback to users.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd python-beginner-projects/projects/computer-algebra
    ```

3. Install dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script `main.py`:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. The application window will appear, consisting of two sections:
    - **Input Section:** Enter the mathematical expression you want to evaluate.
    - **Output Section:** View the result of the evaluation.

3. Choose the desired mathematical operation from the radio buttons.
4. Enter the expression in the input text box.
    - See valid syntax from [Newton API](https://github.com/aunyks/newton-api).
5. Click the "Evaluate" button to perform the selected operation.
6. The result will be displayed in the output section.
