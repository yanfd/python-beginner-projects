**To run the text summarizer project follow these instructions. This project uses Python and the spaCy library for text processing. Here's a step-by-step guide for someone who is not familiar with the process:**

Step 1: Install Required Libraries<br>
Before running the project, make sure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. To install the required libraries, open your command prompt or terminal and execute the following commands:

```pip install spacy``` <br>
```python -m spacy download en_core_web_md``` <br><br>
This will install spaCy and download the English language model used in the project.

<br>
Step 2: Create a Python Script<br>
1. Open a code editor or a text editor of your choice (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Notepad, etc.)<br>
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a new Python file (e.g., text_summarizer.py)

<br><br>
Step 3: Run the Project<br>
Now, you can run the project and enter the text you want to summarize.
1. Open your command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you saved your Python script using the cd command (e.g., cd path/to/your/script/directory).
3. Run the script by typing the following command:
   ```python text_summarizer.py```
   
The program will prompt you to "Enter the text:". Here, you should type or paste the text you want to summarize. Press Enter when you're done. The program will process the text and display the summary as output in the terminal.

That's it! You've successfully run the text summarizer project. It will tokenize the text, score sentences, and generate a summary based on the input you provided.

Make sure to replace **"text_summarizer.py"** with the name you've given to your Python script if it's different.

### HAPPY CODING ALL ☺️
