# SkyCast üå§Ô∏è

SkyCast is a Python application that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific location. It provides two main features: Today's Weather and Forecast Weather. Users can enter a city name, and based on their selection, they will get either the current weather or a weather forecast for the chosen location.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mrinank-Bhowmick/python-beginner-projects.git
   ```

2. Change the directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd python-beginner-projects/projects/Skycast
   ```

3. Obtain an API key from [Weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/).

4. Open the `skycast.py` file and replace `your_api_key_here` with your Weatherbit API key:

   ```python
   self.api_key = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

5. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Run the SkyCast app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run skycast.py
   ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to use SkyCast with your own Weatherbit API key.

## How to Use

2. Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve weather information.

3. If you select "Today's Weather," you will get the current weather details for the chosen city.
