# URL Shortener

## Goal is to have a resuable class that engineers can use or copy/paste into their apps for shortening URLs. Engineer will be able to use any shortening library of their choice. In my example I will be using `pyshorteners`. I will also build an example with bringing a different library into the codebase.

## Using url shortener within this project

### setup
1. Navigate to `projects\url_shortener`
2. Create virtual environment `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment (I am on windows, different on MacOs) `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### execution
1. `python app/main.py`

### example of execution via terminal
```
(venv) python-beginner-projects\projects\url_shortener>`python app/main.py`
Enter the URL you want to shorten: https://www.bing.com/search?q=bing&cvid=e42b0995bcd045849a216437b88847be&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYPDIGCAQQRRg8MgYIBRBFGDzSAQczOTlqMGo0qAIIsAIB&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531
Shortened URL: https://tinyurl.com/275h2qwv
```

### Extras
I built code quality tools into project (linting, formatting, type annotation checks)

1. `ruff check .` - linter
2. `ruff check --fix` - fix linting
3. `ruff format` - formatting
4. `mypy .` - type annotation checking
