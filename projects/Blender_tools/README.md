# Blender Tools with Unreal/Unity

## Description

A series of tools used to store vertex data in various ways. The data can then used in a game engine to animate meshes via a vertex shader.

### Mesh Morpher

Used to store vertex offsets between a meshes shape keys in it's UV layers. Optionally vertex normals from it's second shape key can be stored in it's vertex colors.

### Vertex Animation

Used to store vertex offsets and normals of selected mesh objects per frame into image textures.
