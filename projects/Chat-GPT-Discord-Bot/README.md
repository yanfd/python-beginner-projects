# Requirements

This project requires discord.py version 2.3.2, OpenAI version 1.30.1 and python-dotenv version 1.0.1 which can be installed via `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Manually install requirements:

```bash
pip install discord.py~=2.3.2
```

```bash
pip install openai~=1.30.1
```

```bash
pip install python-dotenv~=1.0.1
```

# ``.env`` File settup

1. Create a ``.env`` file in the bot's root folder. (Same folder as main.py)
2. Format the ``.env`` file as follows, replacing ``TOKEN_HERE``, ``OWNER_UID_HERE``, ``CHAT_GPT_API_KEY_HERE``, ``DISCORD_SERVER_1`` and ``DISCORD_SERVER_2`` with your bot's token, your Discord UID, ChatGPT API key and discord server ID's respectively. Keeping the double quotation marks.
```text
BOT_TOKEN = "TOKEN_HERE"
OWNER_ID = "OWNER_UID_HERE"
GPT_API_KEY = "CHAT_GPT_API_KEY_HERE"
DISCORD_SERVER_1 = "FIRST_DISCORD_SERVER_ID_HERE"
DISCORD_SERVER_2 = "SECOND_DISCORD_SERVER_ID_HERE"
```
For example:
```text
BOT_TOKEN = "12ab56c89"
OWNER_ID = "123456789"
GPT_API_KEY = "12ab56c89"
DISCORD_SERVER_1 = "123456789"
DISCORD_SERVER_2 = "123456789"
```
``OWNER_ID``, ``DISCORD_SERVER_1`` and ``DISCORD_SERVER_2``  must be a numeric whole value

3. The ``.gitignore`` file will ignore the ``.env``.<br>

### Note:

If you want to change the location of the ``.env`` file, you will need to make a reference for it by adding:
```python
dotenv_path = os.path.join("path/to/env", ".env")
```

above ``load_dotenv(override=True)`` and update ``load_dotenv(override=True)`` to:
```python
load_dotenv(dotenv_path, override=True)
```

If you want to change your ``.env`` file name as well add this reference to the ``.env``:
```python
dotenv_path = os.path.join("path/to/env", "Env_Name_Here.env")
```
