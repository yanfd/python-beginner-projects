# How to contribute
First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. We've tried to make a stable project and try to fix bugs and add new features continuously. You can help us do more.

## Getting started

### Check out the projects folder

We have some awesome projects available on the repository. 
If you would like to contribute some more projects which is not there in this repository, feel free to contribute. 
If you found a bug please open an issue.
We are looking for better documentation and optimization of code.


### Writing some code!

Contributing to a project on GitHub is pretty straightforward. If this is your first time, these are the steps you should take.

- Fork this repo.

And that's it! Read the code available and change the part you don't like! Your change should not break the existing code.
 
If you're adding a new functionality, start from the branch **main**. It would be a better practice to create a new branch and work there.

When you're done, submit a pull request asking for one of the maintainers to check it out. We will let you know if there are any problems or changes that should be considered.

### Documentation

Any piece of code that might be challenging to understand is accompanied by comments. If you add new code or modify existing code in a way that affects its functionality or requires changes in its usage, you must document these changes.
